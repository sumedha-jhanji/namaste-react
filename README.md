How to incorporate react in ur project
    Ist way - CDN Links in react
        - network of servers distributed geographically to deliver content to users more efficiently.
        - Benefits of Using a CDN:
            - Faster Load Times: By delivering content from a server closest to the user, CDNs reduce latency and improve load times.
            - Reduced Server Load: Offloading traffic to a CDN reduces the burden on your primary server, enhancing performance.
            - Reliability: CDNs offer redundancy, ensuring content availability even if one server goes down.
            - Scalability: Easily handle high traffic volumes without affecting performance.
        - for react it is a place where we have react libraries hosted and we are pulling these into our project

    2nd Way- 


React not only works on browsers but also on mobiles (react native) etc devices also. That is why w ehave 2 files
    - react -> core react functioality
    - react-dom -> bridge between react and browser having react operations thats can modify document.

If we are rendering any thing root element of HTML, what ever content it earlier has will get replaced with latest render content
